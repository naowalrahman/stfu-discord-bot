# stfu discord bot 

This is a discord bot that aims to really just be a meme. It will make you stfu sometimes, but can do other things as well. 

## Commands
This discord bot uses "." as the prefix. So if you want to execute a command, do `.command`. 

I'm still adding more commands, but these are the ones available right now: 
- Stfu: just says "stfu kid" 
  - syntax: `.stfu`
- Racistmeter: tells you what percent racist you are (totally 100% accurate). This takes a user mention as an argumment, and if no argument is provided, it uses the user sending the message. 
  - syntax: `.racistmeter <optional-mention>` or `.rm <optional-mention>`
- Clownmeter: tells you what percent clown you are (totally 100% accurate). This takes a user mention as an argumment, and if no argument is provided, it uses the user sending the message. 
  - syntax: `.clownmeter <optional-mention>` or `.cm <optional-mention>`
- Whoasked: this takes an argument of a string and checks if anyone asked about it in the last 15 messages. If someone did ask, it send an embed to the message. If no one asked about the given word in the last 15 messages, 
  - syntax: `.whoasked <keyword>` or `.wa <keyword>`
